This is an exercise generated to multiply two N-bit numbers, implemented using Python.

-> In the Pyhon script the multiply_prof_edition-final.py file is reading and writing the Verilog code and updating N respectfully to the input.
-> Verilog code is written in the Verilog(Memory_code file + TestBench for it) using "Vivado HL WebPACK". 

Files : multiplication.v, multiplication_tb.v, rom_16x4.dat are generated after the Python file multiply_prof_edition-final.py has been executed
